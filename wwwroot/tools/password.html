		<h2>About...</h2>
		<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Password_strength&amp;oldid=651343933">
			<p>For passwords generated by a process that randomly selects a
				string of symbols of length, L, from a set of N possible symbols,
				the number of possible passwords can be found by raising the number
				of symbols to the power L, i.e. N<sup>L</sup>. Increasing either L or N will
				strengthen the generated password. The strength of a random password
				as measured by the information entropy is just the base-2 logarithm
				or log<sub>2</sub> of the number of possible passwords, assuming each symbol
				in the password is produced independently. Thus a random password's
				information entropy, H, is given by the formula:</p>
			<img src="/images/entropyMath.png" alt="Entropy formula" />
			<p>where N is the number of possible symbols and L is the number of
				symbols in the password. H is measured in bits. In the last
				expression, log can be to any base.</p>

				"Password strength," Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia,

		<p>Roughly translated, this means that a good password is either made
			up of a lot of symbols from a small pool, or a smaller number of symbols
			from a larger pool. Traditionally, the advice for passwords is to make
			up a "random" word (from a set of upper and lower case letters, and numbers).
			Unfortunately, humans tend to be quite bad at both picking and remembering
			random combinations of letters.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing
				random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.</p>
			<cite>Von Neumann, John. "Various Techniques Used in Connection
				with Random Digits." <i>Applied Math Series</i>, no. 12 (1951): 36-38.</cite>
		</blockquote>
		<p>There are two separate solutions to these two problems. First, use
			a better source of randomness.Modern web browsers offer "cryptographic"
			random numbers, ultimately from external sources of entropy (such as
			the temperature of the CPU, or the time between keystrokes and mouse movements).

		</p>
		<p>Second, write down your (long and complex) passwords. Again, traditionally,
			this has not been good advice, but mostly what you need a password for these
			days is to create an account on a random web site. The "don't write down
			your password" advice protects you against someone with physical access,
			but the threat is more likely to either be someone trying to brute force
			attack the web site login, or to brute force guess the password once
			they've got a copy of the web site database.</p>
		<p>This password generator uses a base list of just over 8000 words. Each
			word can (on a 50/50 choice) have a first capital letter (so effectively
			2 * 8000 = 16000 words). If the additional complexity option is selected,
			each word has one of the ASCII non-alphabetic characters appended
			("!#$%()*+,-./-1234567890:;=?@[\]^_`{|}~" = 39 characters * 16k = 624k). The default
			number of words is 6, so the possible number of combinations is 6<sup>8000 * 2 * 39</sup>
			(= 5*10<sup>34</sup>) or roughly 114 bits of entropy. An 8 digit random
			alpha-numeric string has about 40-50 bits of entropy.</p>
		<p>A final thought - If you're serious about password security, don't
			blindly trust a page you've found online....</p>
