# LinkShare Backend

I want to make it easy for husband and me to share links to cat pictures.

This is part of the system, the other parts are a Chrome extension and a
Android app (which doesn't really work yet)

The system is modeled around Users, Devices, and Links.

Users have Devices. Devices are Link sources and sinks.
